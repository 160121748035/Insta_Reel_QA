Whenever U see a Insta reel which asks a question and says to leave the answer in the comments , U do not need to search for the correct answer in the comments or in the google , U can copy the reels link and paste it in this application , using llama3 it will generate answer for the questions asked in the reel.
Packages U need :
      -  Flask
      -  yt_dlp - for downloading any audio or video content
      -  whisper - to get text from a audio file
 U also need to have - ffmpeg to extract audio from a video+audio file
 I have installed Ollama to run llms on my machine locally and pulled llama3(u can pull miniature models as well) and used it in my application
